		---------
		The earth is motionless
		And poised in space ...
		A great bird resting in its flight
		Between the alleys of the stars.
		It is the wind's hour off ...
		The wind has nestled down among the corn ...
		The two speak privately together,
		Awaiting the whirr of wings.
				Lola Ridge
		"Palladium"
		-----------
		A cortege of clouds'
		shifting planes

		reflected on a river,
		the current's weave deepends,

		yet motionless
		the dramatization of

		a fern unfolding,
		light illumination the air

		for a moment's threshold,
		when time, where we stand,

		corresponds to the day
		held firm,

		derived from the elegance of
		the equation

		for what was once never here.

PROBLEM:
	The problem addressed in this project was how to format string outputs in a program. 
	This was done by having us format two poems of our choice in two different ways, 
	forcing us to make proper use of spacing and escape characters. This was a fairly 
	simple project as the strings were simply copied and pasted from our favorite poems 
	and then formatted with escape characters for line breaks and tabs. The code took 
	approximately 10 minutes.
